# Conway's Game of Life 🌱

Welcome to the implementation of Conway's Game of Life! This repository contains a web-based version of the famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway.

## About the Project 📚

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state, requiring no further input. Players create an initial configuration and observe how it evolves according to a set of simple rules.

**Live Demo:** [game-of-life-puce-seven.vercel.app](https://game-of-life-puce-seven.vercel.app)

## Features ✨

- Interactive grid where you can draw your initial configuration
- Start, stop, and reset functionality
- Adjustable speed of evolution
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **HTML**: Standard markup language for creating web pages
- **SCSS**: CSS pre-processor to enhance the styling capabilities

## Getting Started 🚀

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/manav-gopal/game-of-life.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd game-of-life
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn install
